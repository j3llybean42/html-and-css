        <p> People have very varied opinions on cheeses, and many wil have different favourites to others, as well as some that they hate. Some in particular are quite divisive,
            such as Brie, Camembert and the Blue cheeses. This is usually because they have quite distinctive tastes, and their smells can sometimes make the fridge a bit pongy!

        <p> There are many different things that you can do to eat cheese, including putting it on crackers, in sandwiches, having it melted on toast, or even just 
            eating it in small chunks if you really want to! My favourite way to eat cheese (specifically Brie or Camembert) is to have it is a nice melty toastie or panini, 
            with some cranberry sauce and maybe a bit of bacon. YUM! There are no rules when it comes to cheese, the only limit is your imagination. </p>
